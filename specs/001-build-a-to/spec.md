# Feature Specification: Todo List Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a to-do-list application with Python + FastAPI.
Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
Each task includes a title, description, due date, and priority.
Users can categorize tasks by completion status (completed or pending).
Tasks can be sorted by due date and priority.
The main web UI displays tasks in a clean list, and users can re-order tasks via drag-and-drop.
The backend uses FastAPI to provide RESTful APIs for task management.
The frontend interacts with the APIs to fetch and update data.
Data storage for the MVP version uses SQLite.
Ensure the design supports later extension, such as user authentication, recurring tasks, and integration with external calendars."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a task manager user, I want to organize and track my tasks in a flexible way, so that I can manage my responsibilities effectively. I can create new tasks with details like title, description, due date, and priority, view them in a sorted list, mark them as complete, and reorganize them through drag-and-drop.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the task list is empty, **When** I create a new task with title "Buy groceries", description "Get milk and eggs", due date "2025-09-15", and high priority, **Then** the task appears in the list
2. **Given** there are existing tasks, **When** I mark a task as completed, **Then** it is categorized under completed tasks
3. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** I drag a task to a new position, **Then** the task order is updated accordingly
4. **Given** tasks with different due dates, **When** I sort by due date, **Then** tasks are displayed in chronological order
5. **Given** a task exists, **When** I edit its details, **Then** the changes are saved and displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when creating a task with no title?
- How does the system handle past due dates?
- What happens when dragging a task while the list is being sorted?
- How are tasks displayed when the due date is not set?
- What happens when trying to mark an already completed task as complete?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create tasks with title, description, due date, and priority
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable users to edit existing task details
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to delete tasks
- **FR-004**: System MUST categorize tasks as either completed or pending
- **FR-005**: System MUST support sorting tasks by due date and priority
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist all task data in SQLite database
- **FR-008**: System MUST expose RESTful APIs for task management
